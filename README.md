Here's a complete `README.md` template for your **Candidate Management** CRUD application using MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js:

# Candidate Management System

This is a **CRUD-based web application** designed to manage candidates in a recruitment process. It uses the **MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js)** stack to provide a full-stack solution for managing candidates, including their profile information and images.

## Technologies Used

- **MongoDB**: NoSQL database for storing candidate information.
- **Express.js**: Web framework for Node.js to build the backend API.
- **React.js**: Frontend library to build the user interface.
- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime for server-side logic.
- **Mongoose**: ODM for MongoDB to interact with the database.
- **bcryptjs**: To hash passwords.
- **jsonwebtoken**: For user authentication.
- **multer**: Middleware for handling file uploads (for candidate images).

## Features

- Candidate Profile Management
- Upload Profile Picture
- Authentication & Authorization (JWT Token)
- CRUD Operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for Candidates
- Responsive UI built with React
- User-friendly interface for managing candidates' data

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 14 or above)
- [MongoDB] mongodb+srv://amitkumaryadavwork:c8MEKddOVEponh0L@cluster0.xg6b7.mongodb.net
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

## Getting Started

### Clone the Repository

1. First, clone this repository to your local machine.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/amitkumar88825/candidate-management.git
cd candidate-management
```

### Client-Side Setup

1. Navigate to the `client` directory:

```bash
cd client
```

2. Install the necessary dependencies for the React client:

```bash
npm install
```

3. start client server using npm start in client directory

```

Your React app should now be running at `http://localhost:3000`.

### Server-Side Setup

1. Navigate to the `server` directory:

```bash
cd server
```

2. Install the necessary dependencies for the backend:

```bash
npm install
```

3. Create a `.env` file in the `server` directory to store your environment variables:

```env
PORT = 5000
MONGO_URI=mongodb+srv://amitkumaryadavwork:c8MEKddOVEponh0L@cluster0.xg6b7.mongodb.net
JWT_SECRET=01bbf0491449079af278ec226529c86f87a0341066b75406d28d4ac6d2bf1b9385927cfc1b49eb061bfe2284067c03f531b717264d116ca1a4a968dc97134521

```

- `MONGO_URI`: Replace this with your MongoDB connection string (local or from MongoDB Atlas).
- `JWT_SECRET`: Replace this with a secure secret key used for signing JWT tokens.

4. Start the Node.js server:

```bash
npm start
```

Your server should now be running at `http://localhost:5000`.

### Running Both Client and Server

Once both the client and server are running, you can access the full application in your browser by going to `http://localhost:3000`.
